{21}{The swamp trail leads to a great mound by the shore of a darklake. The mound looks like it was once a huge deadfall. A number of living tree trunks still jut from its mass along with splintered stumps and moss-covered logs. Gaps between the logs have been fi lled with underbrush and crude mud wattle. Directly before you is a wicker gate leading inside. Two guttering torches mark the entrance. A muddy path meanders east toward the water.}{}{1}{}{0}{}
